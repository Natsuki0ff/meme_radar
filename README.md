# Meme Radar Program

This program scans all the sub-domains of knowyourmeme, giving you an overview of all the memes created since the history of mankind.
This Python program is designed to scrape subdomains from a website, filter and save them into a file, and display the results in a graphical interface using Tkinter. It allows users to find and track subdomains related to memes hosted on the "Know Your Meme" website.

## Features:
- **Web Scraping**: It fetches pages containing meme subdomains.
- **Filtering**: Excludes certain irrelevant pages based on predefined filters.
- **State Management**: Keeps track of the last page processed and continues from there.
- **Subdomain Saving**: Saves found subdomains in a `.txt` file.
- **GUI**: Displays the subdomains in a Tkinter window with auto-scrolling.
- **Dark Mode**: The GUI interface uses a dark theme for better visibility.

## Requirements:

- **Python 3.x**: The program requires Python 3 or later.
- **Libraries**: 
  - `requests`
  - `beautifulsoup4`
  - `tkinter`

You can install the necessary libraries using pip:
```bash
pip install requests beautifulsoup4
```

## Configuration:

### File Paths:
Make sure to adjust the paths to the text files to match your system. By default, the program saves the following files to the Desktop:

1. **Subdomain File** (`sub_domains.txt`): This file contains the found subdomains.
2. **State File** (`program_state.txt`): This file tracks the last processed page number.
3. **Not Found File** (`not_found.txt`): This file logs pages with no subdomains.

### Modifying Paths:
You will need to change the file paths in the script to match your computer's directories.

For example:
```python
output_file = r"C:\Users\YourUsername\Desktop\sub_domains.txt"
state_file = r"C:\Users\YourUsername\Desktop\program_state.txt"
not_found_file = r"C:\Users\YourUsername\Desktop\not_found.txt"
```

Replace `YourUsername` with your actual username and ensure the directories exist on your computer.

## How to Run:

1. **Modify Paths**: Open the script and ensure that the paths for the `.txt` files match your system configuration.
   
2. **Start the Program**: Run the Python script using a terminal or command prompt:
   ```bash
   python subdomain_finder.py
   ```

3. **View Results**: As the program runs, the subdomains will be displayed in a Tkinter window, and the results will be saved in the `sub_domains.txt` file.

4. **Stop the Program**: You can stop the program at any time by clicking the **Stop** button in the Tkinter window.

---

## Program Behavior:

1. **Pagination**: The program scrapes subdomains across multiple pages. It starts at the first page and continues to the next page until all subdomains are found.
2. **Subdomain Extraction**: Subdomains are extracted from links containing `/memes/` and are filtered to exclude unwanted pages like "researching", "guidelines", etc.
3. **State Saving**: The program saves the current page number so that if you stop the program, it will continue from where it left off when restarted.
4. **Subdomain Saving**: Each unique subdomain is saved into `sub_domains.txt`, with duplicate subdomains being ignored.

---

## Additional Notes:

- **Error Handling**: If there is an issue with the web request (e.g., connection error or invalid response), the program will stop scraping.
- **No Subdomains Found**: If no subdomains are found on a page, the page number is saved in `not_found.txt` for reference.
- **ASCII Art**: If the output file is empty, the program will append an ASCII art header to `sub_domains.txt`.

## Example Output:

The `sub_domains.txt` file will look like this after the program has run:
```
___  ___                     ______          _            
|  \/  |                     | ___ \        | |           
| .  . | ___ _ __ ___   ___  | |_/ /__ _  __| | __ _ _ __ 
| |\/| |/ _ \ '_ ` _ \ / _ \ |    // _` |/ _` |/ _` | '__| 
| |  | |  __/ | | | | |  __/ | |\ \ (_| | (_| | (_| | |   
\_|  |_/\___|_| |_| |_|\___| \_| \_\__,_|\__,_|\__,_|_|   
                                                          
                                                          
meme-subdomain-1
meme-subdomain-2
...
```

In the Tkinter interface, you will see a list of subdomains as they are found.

## Troubleshooting:

- **No Data Found**: Ensure that the URL base is correct and the website is accessible. Also, check the filtering logic to ensure it's not excluding too many pages.
- **File Permission Errors**: Ensure that the program has write access to the specified file paths.
- **Missing Libraries**: If you get an error about missing libraries, ensure they are installed using `pip`.
